# Intellectual Property and Global Inequality

The current intellectual property system often reinforces and exacerbates global inequalities. This chapter examines how patent and copyright laws affect access to knowledge, technology, and cultural works across different regions and economic contexts.

We explore case studies in areas such as pharmaceutical patents, educational materials, and technological innovation to understand how intellectual property rights impact global development and equality. Through this analysis, we reveal the urgent need for more equitable approaches to managing intellectual property on a global scale.
