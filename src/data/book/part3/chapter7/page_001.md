# Intellectual Property and the Training Data Dilemma

The development of AI systems relies heavily on vast amounts of training data, much of which is protected by copyright. This chapter explores the complex legal and ethical questions surrounding the use of copyrighted materials in AI training.

We examine the concept of fair use in the context of machine learning, the rights of content creators whose works are used to train AI systems, and the potential impact on future innovation. Through this analysis, we reveal the fundamental tension between traditional intellectual property rights and the development of artificial intelligence.
