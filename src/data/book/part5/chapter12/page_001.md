# Rethinking Intellectual Property Laws

As we confront the challenges of artificial intelligence, global inequality, and digital transformation, it becomes clear that our intellectual property system requires fundamental reform. This chapter proposes new frameworks for managing and protecting creative works while fostering innovation and ensuring equitable access to knowledge.

We explore potential legal reforms, alternative compensation models, and new approaches to balancing creator rights with public benefit. Through these proposals, we begin to outline a path toward a more effective and equitable intellectual property system.
