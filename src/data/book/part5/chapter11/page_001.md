# Open Source and Creative Commons

The open source movement and Creative Commons licensing have emerged as powerful alternatives to traditional intellectual property frameworks. This chapter examines these innovative approaches to sharing and protecting creative works, exploring their successes, limitations, and potential for broader application.

We analyze how these models have transformed software development, scientific research, and creative production, offering valuable lessons for the future of intellectual property. Through these examples, we begin to see practical alternatives to the current system.
