# File Structure

The Book Reader uses a simple and organized file structure for content management. Here's how to organize your book:

## Directory Structure

```
src/data/book/
├── introduction/
│   └── chapter1/
│       └── page_001.md
├── part1/
│   ├── chapter1/
│   │   └── page_001.md
│   └── chapter2/
│       └── page_001.md
└── part2/
    └── chapter1/
        └── page_001.md
```

## Naming Conventions

- Parts: `part1`, `part2`, etc.
- Chapters: `chapter1`, `chapter2`, etc.
- Pages: `page_001.md`, `page_002.md`, etc.

This structure makes it easy to organize and maintain your content while keeping it scalable for larger books.
